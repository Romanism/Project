## 1. Overview

#### 1.1 Project Period
- 시작일 : 2018/07/27
- 종료일 : 2018/

#### 1.3 Description

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.


: 데이터를 통해 승객의 생존여부를 판단하는 문제


#### 1.4 Evaluation (Accuracy)

Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known simply as "accuracy”.




#### 1.5 Data set

- train.csv - should be used to build your machine learning models.
- test.csv - should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data
